# What is a career?
Honestly, come back in 10 years. Maybe, just maybe I might be able to explain it by looking back at mine. 

No, but seriuously, just keep your options open.

## Have you heard of Mandela?
You have? How about the Mandela effect? No? Well, without going into too many specifics it's a thing that happens when you start fabricating memories that didn't occur. Most of the time, with very specific details.

Now, keeping that in mind. Do you know Asimo? That little robot that was way ahead of its time back in the two thousands? Well, hopefully this isn't the Mandela effect (90% sureit is) but I remember that when I was a little kid I freaked out when I first saw that little bipedal robot. It was awesome. The future! And right there I knew I wanted to work for the company that made it. Then I completely forgot about it and moved on...

It's funny where life takes you. It is not funny how drastically life can change in just a few years (I promise there's a point here... somewhere) 

Have you heard of never say never? Well, back in school I used to say I will never do web development for a living, and here I am, 4 companies later, 1 master later, 1 published paper later, and somehow one of my main projects at work ended up being developing a web based tool. Funny right?

Well, remember that little robot? I  also ended up working for that company. And what's more interesting, is that I've never been closer to work with actual robots! But here I am, developing a tool, a web-based tool for a robot. And you know what? I kinda dig it.
