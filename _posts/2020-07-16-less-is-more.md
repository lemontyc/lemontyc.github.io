I just spent about **2 hours** looking for a new theme for this website.

There are a **lot** of them. With tons of features and things I will never use. It was really hard to pick one.

At the end I went with the this one (the current theme as of **July 2020**).

I really like it. It’s simple, looks good and if I need more stuff, I’ll just add it!

Sometimes, really **less is more**

(I really wish this applied to review articles as well).

Anyways, back to writing that article…
