So there was I. Somewhere in high school when suddenly I was very bored. I remembered that I saw somewhere (probs 9gag since it was ‚ÄúThe Thing‚Äù back in the day) multiple posts of something called Minecraft and decided to check it out. And so, it began‚Ä¶

Multiple hours invested (not wasted üòâ ) in that video game. I started playing just before it began to be a thing on the internet. I remember that soon, most of YouTube was Minecraft let‚Äôs plays, in which I think I also invested a considerable amount of time. It was a fun thing to do, basically if you went to the trending section everything was Minecraft related.

I soon built my very first dirt house. I mastered finding diamonds, I created a tree house, a cave house, a subway transport system with mine carts (oh.. the good old mine cart boosters glitch)‚Ä¶ **Everything was possible!**

>However, I wanted more.

That‚Äôs how I went searching for my first online minecraft experience. I looked for a small server with a nice community. And eventually found PlayRobot. Found a [twitter](https://twitter.com/playrobotmc) account (which I‚Äôm not sure if it is legit, as I wasn‚Äôt into twitter at that time) and a MinecraftForum [post](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/minecraft-survival-servers/1174295-playrobot-bukkit-cracked-1-2-5-grief-free-99-9-no), both of which obviously are not being updated since 2012. But the server was nice. I quickly went through the ranks and somehow became an Admin. Oh the power, the unlimited inventory, and god mode‚Ä¶..

>But that wasn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶ I still wanted more‚Ä¶

I started my own server (hosted in my laptop): BTM or Better than Minecraft, because it was a bukkit server with mods, which clearly made Minecraft better! But I hated the name. And my crappy laptop was barely able to run both the server and a client for me to play on the server. It was time to upgrade.

BTM became **Cubic Empire**! And I also paid for an online server! I even made (probably the best logo I‚Äôve made so far) and so it began‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs what I was able to find regarding that server:
* Amazing Hyper High Res logo: with which I learnt Photoshop (Or Illustrator, don‚Äôt really remember which one was)
  * ![no-alignment]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2020-01-17-that-time-i-sold-a-minecraft-server/cubicempire.png)
  * So it‚Äôs a cube inside a cube, but it also says CE for Cubic Empire. ``See? I‚Äôm smart!``
* Another MinecraftForum [post](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/minecraft-survival-servers/1090437-cubic-empire-best-cracked-sever-ever).
* And an Enjin [site](https://cubicempire.enjin.com/inactive). Which was a big thing back in the day? (I also got the logo from that site, apparently I don‚Äôt have those files anymore).
* A YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucWIJZSGoZE) of the server (after I sold it).

Although sadly, everything other than the logo was made after I left the server and sold it.

# Why did I leave?

It‚Äôs complicated. Minecraft was something that allowed me to escape reality while I was finishing high school. I saw the potential it would have if I became a youtuber, so I was trying to do high school, be part of a robotics team, try to get into a university in another state and‚Ä¶ well, it was a lot.

Too much work was involved to provide the experience I was looking for. I tried though! I tried to automate most of the boring stuff and setup ‚Äúprocesses‚Äù that would make it easier to manage said server. But somehow, I wasn‚Äôt giving it the attention it deserved. So.. I sold it.

There was this player that gained my trust. And decided to sell it to him. So I did and that was pretty much it. Cubic Empire, I think lasted about 2 more years since I sold it. I barely got online after that so I‚Äôm not sure..

But yeah, I ran a Minecraft server of 40 people and managed to sell it.

Good times üòâ
