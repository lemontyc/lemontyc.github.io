It's been a while! Hasn't it?

Almost 4 years to the date from my last post. That's when "stuff" hit the fan.  Funny how so many things can change in so little time, although granted, it hasn't been that short of a time.

# What's changed?

Remember the last post? The rant about scientific writing? Well, that came from writing a paper. Its published now, in a very presitgious journal. Some would say it's the best journal, the only journal! There are some people that wouldn't say that. Those are people that, let me tell you this, they haven't published in the best journal! 

I also graduated from my masters. Oh! I moved abroad for work. It was for a good job, the bestest job.... ok I'm done now. Found out the job wasn't the best fit for me, switched jobs, and now I'm the closest I've ever been to working with an actual robot! That's exciting! right? Well...

# It's funny how life works, right?

The only constant is change! Trust me, that was said by someone somewhere. Probably someone important! The most important! Ok. I'm really done now.  I didn't believe this, but welp, funny how life works, right? (hey! it's the title of the section). 

Right now I'm at a point where I'm kinda just cruising. I like where I'm at. I'm happy about the choices that brought me where I am. Wouldn't change a thing! Except for maybe knowing what life is going to look like in 10 years. But this is impossible! right? Well, for now it is. And that's a good thing. It makes the future exciting!

# What's next?

Who the * knows? Maybe some new AI/robotics projects? hopefully something fun and exciting that lets me colaborate with old (and new) friends! For now, I'm climbing again (literally, rock climbing lol), I'm taking pictures of stuff different than nature, and people seem to be liking it. My GF? She's my fiance√© (too many e's?)now. Wedding soon-ish?  

Oh, yeah! about that funny life? Welp, I'm enjoying parts other than work in my life for now. Work is not, and should not be the most important thing in your life. There's a whole world out (side of work) there. Take this piece of wisdom and **Go Explore!**

That's it for now.
