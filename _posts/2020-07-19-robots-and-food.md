What an incredible and crazy year 2020 has been so far. As if life wasn’t complicated enough, SARS-CoV-2 joined the party. And wow… We will remember this one.

Anyways… Regarding those resolutions, I’ve got some updates:

* Learn to cook 3 new dishes **Done** (Chocolate chip cookies, rotisserie chicken, octopus tacos, Chicken Alfredo Pasta).
* I started the **Udacity Robotics thing**! No scholarship though. But got a huge discount. Just need to finish it to mark it as completed in the resolutions thing. This one also kinda contributes in the “rediscover my passion” thing.
* That’s it!
And yes, a lot of the resolutions will be affected by the pandemic/quarantine. Bummer :/.
