2020 is a trap!

Another year has gone by. It is amazing what just 365 days can do with your life. It seems it was only yesterday when 2019 started and **\<insert generic motivational speech here\>…**

Not gonna lie to the 1 person who will probably read this when published.

2019 was a year with a lot of thinking from my side. Wanted to do a lot of things at the same time (which I now know how it went. Spoiler alert: not great). However. some great stuff happened as well:

* I started living on my very first apartment on my own.
* I went scuba diving at the beautiful Laguna de la Media Luna. Which is also a great camping spot!
* Did my very first corporate travel (make that 2 travels).
* Adopted Mr. Momo (an awesome pupper which is currently asleep besides me)
* Went on a holiday with my girlfriend’s family (definitely a new experience)
* Bought my very first furniture.

There are quite more things that I did for the very first time in 2019. But these are the ones that came to mind. However, the most important one, is that I-m finally figuring life (sort of). Which is why I have these new year’s resolutions:

* Start a master’s degree.
* Rediscover my passion for making robots and programming.
* Enroll and complete the Udacity’s Robotics nanodegree program *a scholarship would be nice as well cof, cof*
* Read at least 1 book per month ( gotta use that kindle). It’d be nice to reach 24 books by the end of the year.
* Teach Momo to:
  * spin both to the left and to the right.
  * Pray.
  * Talk.
  * Fetch.
* Master [Cha Cha Cha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME-K2UOWZ5Y) from Jósean Log ukelele song.
* Master [Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg) from Family of the year (guitar).
* Look for and learn at least 2 other songs (making a total of 3 with previous one) for each instrument. So…   I should learn 6 new songs total (uke and guitar).
* Get an internship in robotics at NVIDIA. Doesn’t matter if it is a summer/winter or spring one. I want to work on their Isaac robotics SDK.
* Finish what Autonome (previous year startup) started. Also, website is not working, gotta fix that!
* Buy a couch! for that new apartment ;).
* Discover and play new board games.
* Do a photography trip somewhere.
* Learn to cook 3 new dishes.
* Have an awesome vacation with friends.
* Start and continue publishing a blog! (Halfway there already)
* Keep updating this site regarding my adventures into doing what I love.
* Go camping 2 or 3 times or more. And get into astrophotography for bonus points!

Hopefully that will be enough to keep me busy for a year. I’m very happy that I’m starting this year with a plan (that took more than a fricking year to materialize). A plan that involves my interests and will (hopefully) get me closer to do my passion.

Looking forward to that 2021 and see all of these things here accomplished.

Me, when 2020 started
>One thing at a time

Me, trying to finish this post.

Until next time!
