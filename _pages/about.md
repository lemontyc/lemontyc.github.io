Iâ€™m a robotics engineer who loves solving challenging problems by building and programming robots. I also consider myself an amateur nature.


## What can you find here?

I intend to use this GitHub-hosted website as my personal blog for everything. Stuff you might find (but not limited to):
* quotes
* adventures
* tips
* projects (anything code-related should be at my pesonal [GitHub](https://github.com/lemontyc))


## Who's the target audience?

Me in the near feature might be the best answer. But, at the end, anyone that finds this and reads it.

## CV?

Not here, but head to my public [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lemontyc/) profile.
